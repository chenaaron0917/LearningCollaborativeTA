# LearningCollaborativeTA
We propose an iterative learning framework for autonomous agents in human-autonomy teams to understand human behaviors from demonstrations and synergistically collaborate with human-like agents that imitates real human
decision-makers. The framework has two learning objectives. The first objective is to train the human-like agent from demonstrations by playing with other autonomous agents, and the second objective is to improve the decisions of autonomous agents by interacting with the trained humanlike
agent. The two objectives do not stand by themselves since one-step improvement may not capture the full behavior expectation from humans. Instead, the two objectives can be achieved by learning iteratively from each other.
